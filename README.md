# Swift Invaders Game

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCulbertson/Swift-Invaders-Game/master/Swift%20Invaders/SwiftInvaders/Assets.xcassets/logo.imageset/logo.png)

This is a Space Invaders clone made using Swift 3 in 200 lines of code! It is to demonstrate optimizations in programming with Swift.

TODO: If you'd like to use this project for something other than just learning Swift, I'd recommend tweaking the collision detection rate.

You can use this project in anyway you see fit. WTFPL

Enjoy Swifting!
